# Fastdata
Apache Storm ( Trident ), Redis, Node.js, Socket.IO based Real Time Dashboards

What is Fastdata ?

Again, there are confusingly many definitions in the web for Fastdata, I would like to keep it simple, but I am assuming some understanding on the basics of big data platforms. So you can call your data platform does fastdata if you have a provision in your data platform to "continosuly query" large volumes and velocities of big data streams (yes you read it) to make real time business decisions. 2 flavours of continous queries are Stream processing or Event Stream processing (SP) and Complex event Processing (CEP).

**Fastdata = Real-time Big data**

Why now ?

What do we lose without Fastdata ?
