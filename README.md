Apache Storm ( Trident ), Redis, Node.js, Socket.IO based Real Time Dashboards

**What is Fastdata ?**

Again, there are many different (confusing) definitions in the web for Fastdata. I would like to keep it simple, but I am assuming some understanding on the basics of big data platforms. One such good definition is here [http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608040/big-data/fast-data--the-next-step-after-big-data.html]. So you can call your data platform does fastdata if you have a provision in your data platform to "continosuly query" large volumes and velocities of big data streams (yes you read it) to make real time business decisions. Usually these kind of high velocity data streams are termed as "firehoses" in bigdata world. There are 2 flavours of continous queries are *Stream processing or Event Stream processing (SP)* and *Complex event Processing (CEP)*.

**Fastdata = Real-time Big data**

**Why now ?**

**What do we lose without Fastdata ?**
